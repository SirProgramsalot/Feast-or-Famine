### Description
Feast or Famine is a tower defence game where you place units and destroy incoming enemies. Strategically place units to maximize your food and keep your village safe.
Be careful though, because enemies steal you food upon reaching the village, and running out of food will cause you to lose!
### Technology Stack
We used the C++ library EnTT, which implements the data oriented ECS architectural pattern. 
OpenGL was used for rendering. 
### Result
This project won 2/3 of the awards (Best gameplay, Best Overall) of the CPSC 427 2021 class. There were 11 other teams!

### My contributions
View rig.cpp, rope.cpp, dragon_rig.cpp for examples of some code I contributed to the project. Making the dragon rig work with the existing rendering pipeline required a sound understanding of working with matrix transforms.
